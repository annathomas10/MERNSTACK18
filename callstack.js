//stacksize is very limited it gets blown up if we do not control the iterations

//blow up the stack - RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded

"A downside of this model is that if a message takes too long to complete, the web 
application is unable to process user interactions like click or scroll. "
setTimeout:
" For this reason, the second argument indicates a minimum time â€” not a guaranteed time."
"Zero delay doesn't mean the call back will fire-off after zero milliseconds"
"The execution depends on the number of waiting tasks in the queue"
"A very interesting property of the event loop model is that JavaScript, 
unlike a lot of other languages, never blocks"
"Legacy exceptions exist like alert or synchronous XHR, but it is considered good practice
to avoid them. Beware: exceptions to the exception do exist (but are usually implementation 
bugs, rather than anything else)."
